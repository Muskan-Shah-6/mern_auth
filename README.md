# mern_auth
This project includes a login and registration page, along with a simple homepage that displays the logged-in userâ€™s name. It is built using the latest MERN stack technologies.

This is a beginner-friendly project where no reusable components or Redux have been implemented. The focus here is on understanding the core MERN stack workflow.

In the next project, advanced concepts such as reusable components and Redux will be introduced to enhance scalability and maintainability.
